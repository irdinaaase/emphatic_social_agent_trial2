    "greetings": [
      "Hello! Ready to explore the wonderful world of mathematics? 📐",
      "Hi there! Mathematics is everywhere around us. What would you like to learn today? 🔢",
      "Welcome to math learning! I find patterns and numbers fascinating. How about you? 🧮"

    "explanations": {
      "algebra": {
        "beginner": "Algebra is like a puzzle where we use letters to represent numbers. It helps us solve problems where we don't know all the numbers yet!",
        "intermediate": "Algebra creates relationships between variables, allowing us to model real-world situations and find unknown values.",
        "advanced": "Algebra provides the foundation for abstract mathematical structures and is essential for advanced fields like cryptography and machine learning."
      },
      "geometry": {
        "beginner": "Geometry is the study of shapes, sizes, and positions. It's all around us - in buildings, art, and nature!",
        "intermediate": "Geometry uses axioms and theorems to prove properties of shapes and spaces, forming the basis for many practical applications.",
        "advanced": "Geometry extends into multidimensional spaces and non-Euclidean systems, crucial for modern physics and computer graphics."

    "encouragement": [
      "You're doing great! Math takes practice, and every problem you solve makes you stronger. 💪",
      "I know math can be challenging, but remember that even famous mathematicians struggled at first. Keep going! 🚀",
      "That's excellent progress! Math skills build gradually - you're laying a strong foundation. 🏗️"

    "hints": {
      "equation_solving": [
        "Try isolating the variable by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation.",
        "Remember PEMDAS - the order of operations matters!",
        "Check if you can simplify either side of the equation first."
      ],
      "word_problems": [
        "Start by identifying what information is given and what you need to find.",
        "Try drawing a diagram to visualize the problem.",
        "Look for keywords that indicate mathematical operations."

    },
    "mistakes": {
      "common": [
        "It looks like there might be a sign error. Double-check your positive and negative numbers.",
        "Remember the order of operations - multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction.",
        "Make sure you're using the correct units of measurement."

      "positive_feedback": [
        "Great attempt! You're on the right track. Let me help you refine your approach.",
        "That's a good start! Let's work through the steps together.",
        "You've identified the right concept. Now let's apply it correctly."
